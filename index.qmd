Hi, I'm Viviana Luccioli! I'm currently a first year student in Georgetown University's M.S. in Data Science and Analytics program. I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2024 with double majors in Applied Statistics with a concentration in Biostatistics (B.A.) and Global Public Health (B.A.). In the summer of 2025, I'll be interning as a Statistician and Data Analyst in the Federal Reserve Board's Information and Technology Department in Washington, D.C. Previously, I interned as a Data Manager and Engineer for City of Promise, a local nonprofit providing services to combat generational poverty in Charlottesville, Virginia. I also have extensive research experience, including an internship as a research assistant for a professor's contract in developing the international guidelines on controlled medicine policy for the World Health Organization. I also have experience as an assistant on a Swedish research team investigating trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ removal in Stockholm.

At Georgetown, I'm acitvely involved in my graduate program, working part time as a research assistant in Dr. Qiwei He's AI Measurement and Development lab, where I'm contributing to technical research review on the development of VR technology for educational assistance as well as performing quantitative analysis on educational behavioral data. I'm also a student academic assistant in the Professional Development Center, where I meets one on one to mentor students through resumes, cover letter writing, and interview preparation for data science roles. I also write blogs for the program website-- feel free to check them out [here!](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/) Lastly, I'm a teaching assistant for DSAN 6150: Biological and Biomedical Data Science. 

My multidisciplinary background and experiences in a vast range of professional and academic settings have shaped my effective communication skills, adaptability to working in new groups, and well-rounded and contextually-cognizant approach to data problems. Furthermore, I'm fluent in Italian and Spanish, and I love meeting people with different backgrounds than mine (whether that be culturally or academically). I'm passionate about harnessing my unique perspective and analytical skills to catalyze data-driven solutions that create meaningful social impact. 

If you have any questions or even just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at vcl16@georgetown.edu -- I'm always happy to make a new connection. :)
