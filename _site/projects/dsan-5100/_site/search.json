    "text": "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), “using the best available research and data to guide decisions is the key to evidence-informed policymaking.”(Goodwin, n.d.) This project examines pre-Dobbs data collected from official, reliable sources and evaluates it in the context of current abortion policies across U.S. states.\nOur analysis reveals a troubling trend: states that implemented abortion bans, and restrictions were already linked to poor outcomes in overall health, maternal health and wellness, and child health— even before post-Dobbs abortion policies took effect. Despite these alarming findings, a handful of states still opted to enact policies that restrict reproductive freedom and maternal health— policies that extensive research predicts will further exacerbate these already dire outcomes. (Lantz et al., n.d.), (Madden, Trawick, and Yee, n.d.), (Kheyfets et al. 2023)\nThis project highlights the glaring absence of data-driven policymaking in many states when it comes to the topic of abortion. Furthermore, it challenges the anti-abortion movement’s fundamental notion of being “pro-life.” Based on these findings, states that uphold reproductive rights demonstrate significantly lower infant and maternal mortality rates, suggesting that they are, in fact, more aligned with the true essence of being “pro-life.” This project’s results call for further research into these policies’ repercussions, more transparent data, and heightened awareness surrounding the objective consequences of reproductive policy regardless of moral and ethical debate."

    "text": "Implications\nThis project highlights various implications and consequences of the implementation of restrictive abortion policies.\n\nExacerbated inequities and hardships\nPrevious scholarly research has highlighted the profound direct and indirect consequences of restricted or prohibited abortion access. The consequences of such policies are ubiquitous and multifaceted, unilaterally reshaping a person’s life. , spanning diverse societal and personal dimensions. One of the most comprehensive explorations in this field is the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study conducted by the University of California San Francisco’s ANSIRH (Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health) that examines the impact of unwanted pregnancies and restricted abortion access on women’s lives. With findings published in over 50 peer-reviewed papers, the study is widely recognized for its rigor and reliability. The most prominent takeaway from the study is that “receiving an abortion does not harm the health and wellbeing of women, but in fact, being denied an abortion results in worse financial, health, and family outcomes.”(2022) Specifically, the study finds that women denied abortion are:\n\nMore likely to experience serious complications from the end of pregnancy, resulting in eclampsia and maternal mortality\nMore likely to raise the child alone\nMore likely to not be able to leave abusive partners\nMore likely to suffer anxiety and loss of self-esteem in the short term after being denied an abortion\nMore likely to experience poor physical health for years after the pregnancy, including chronic pain and gestational hypertension\n\nThe impact extends to children as well. The Turnaway study also found that babies born from unwanted pregnancies are more likely to live in poverty and unstable conditions, and that children already in the family also face worsened economic and social outcomes. Furthermore, a 2023 study revealed that restricted abortion access corresponds to an 11% increase in foster care entries(Adkins et al. 2024), underscoring the cascading effects of unwanted pregnancies. Without adequate resources to raise a child, many women face untenable circumstances, straining an already overwhelmed foster care system and increasing the likelihood of children growing up in adverse conditions. These findings reveal that abortion restrictions jeopardize not only women’s health and autonomy but also the safety and well-being of children.\nAdditional research underscores the broader societal harm of restrictive abortion policies. For instance, abortion bans are linked to increases in maternal mortality rates, with a particularly devastating effect on Black women.(Kheyfets et al. 2023) Studies project that such bans could lead to a 24% rise in overall maternal deaths(Spitzer, Weitz, and Buchanan 2024), with a 33% increase among non-Hispanic Black women.(Stevenson 2021) Limits on clinic availability and early gestational restrictions alone could raise maternal mortality by 6–15% and up to 38%, respectively.(Kheyfets et al. 2023)\nOur research further highlights that teen birth rates are highest in states with the most restrictive abortion policies and lowest in states with more protective ones. Abortion access is vital for teens aspiring to pursue education and careers before considering parenthood. As restrictive policies widen this gap, teen birth rates are expected to rise, disproportionately burdening restrictive states and compounding long-term economic and social inequities. Reduced workforce participation and career advancement opportunities for young women will inevitably hinder the nation’s economic growth and competitiveness.\nCompounding these challenges are the economic realities faced by women in states with restrictive abortion policies, which often fail to provide parental leave or job protections postpartum. These systemic shortcomings place immense strain on mothers, particularly single mothers and those recovering from pregnancy complications, pushing many into financial instability. The lack of benefits, coupled with the costs of raising a child, exacerbates poverty and widens economic disparities, with rippling effects across families, communities, and the nation as a whole.\nIn sum, restrictive abortion policies do far more than limit access to medical care—they amplify inequities, destabilize families, and threaten the health, well-being, and economic future of countless women and children.\n\n\nTravel\nThe negative impacts of restrictive abortion policy post the Dobbs decision are reflected via the analysis of travel data.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(networkD3)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(usmap)\nlibrary(sf)\n\ndf &lt;- read_csv(\"data/clean_data/merged_data.csv\")\n# head(df)\n\nabortion_map_data &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(State, `percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(`percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    state = State,\n    change = `percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`\n  )\n\ncapitals_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    city = c(\n        \"Boise\", \"Pierre\", \"Des Moines\", \"Jefferson City\", \"Little Rock\",\n        \"Baton Rouge\", \"Austin\", \"Oklahoma City\", \"Jackson\", \"Montgomery\",\n        \"Tallahassee\", \"Nashville\", \"Frankfort\", \"Indianapolis\", \"Charleston\"\n    ),\n    lon = c(\n        -116.200, -100.346, -93.603, -92.189, -92.289,\n        -91.187, -97.743, -97.503, -90.182, -86.279,\n        -84.280, -86.781, -84.878, -86.162, -81.633\n    ),\n    lat = c(\n        43.617, 44.367, 41.591, 38.579, 34.746,\n        30.457, 30.266, 35.482, 32.298, 32.377,\n        30.438, 36.162, 38.186, 39.768, 38.336\n    ),\n    state = c(\n        \"Idaho\", \"South Dakota\", \"Iowa\", \"Missouri\", \"Arkansas\",\n        \"Louisiana\", \"Texas\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Mississippi\", \"Alabama\",\n        \"Florida\", \"Tennessee\", \"Kentucky\", \"Indiana\", \"West Virginia\"\n    )\n)\n\ncapitals_mapped &lt;- usmap_transform(capitals_df, input_names = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"))\n\ncapitals_mapped &lt;- capitals_mapped %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        x = st_coordinates(.)[, 1], # Extract x coordinates\n        y = st_coordinates(.)[, 2] # Extract y coordinates\n    )\n\nplot_usmap(data = abortion_map_data, values = \"change\") +\n    geom_point(\n        data = capitals_mapped,\n        aes(x = x, y = y),\n        shape = 8, \n        size = 2, \n        color = \"red\", \n        stroke = 1\n    ) + \n    scale_fill_gradient2(\n        name = \"% Change\",\n        low = \"#ff6b6b\",\n        mid = \"#ffffff\",\n        high = \"#4dbd00\",\n        midpoint = 0,\n        na.value = \"gray80\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n        legend.position = \"right\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)\n    ) +\n    labs(title = \"Change in Clinician-Provided Abortions Since 2020 by State\", caption = \"* indicate 'Most Restrictive' states\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows the variation of clinician-provided abortions since 2020 across U.S. states. States such as Wyoming and New Mexico have seen about a 300% increase in clinician-provided abortions. Additionally, there appears to be a geographic pattern, where the most restrictive states (*) are often adjacent to states showing increases in clinician-provided abortions, implying an increase in demand in neighboring states with more protective policies.\nWe were also able to gather data on the flow of travel to access an abortion between each pairwise combination of states for the year 2023, and the plot below visualizations the magnitude and avenues of these travel trends.\n\nThe Sankey diagram depicts a complex web of interstate travel for abortion services, with lines connecting home states (left) to destination states (right). Texas appears to have the highest number of people traveling out of state for abortion-related services, as shown by the multiple thick lines flowing from Texas to various destinations. One interesting finding is that even though Florida is considered a restrictive state, there seems to be an abundance of people traveling there for services.\nThese visualizations show that states with neighbors that have enacted abortion bans in the years since the Dobbs decision often experienced surges in the number of clinician-provided abortions since 2020. This suggests that in states with restrictive abortion policies, women with the means to do so travel to obtain abortions. While it is certainly positive that these women are able to obtain the care they need, the unfortunate reality of the situation is that this exacerbates underlying inequalities. Women without the means to travel for an abortion face forced births. As this project’s analysis has found, states with abortion bans in place frequently have less support systems and care in place for women in this position. The result is a twisted inequity: those with the least means are given the least support. This has the potential to initiate a malicious negative cycle, as women and children are negatively impacted in a ripple effect, from financial means to mental health. Ultimately, while it is not within the scope of this paper, it is not unlikely that this has negative impacts on the state as a whole."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\n\nChallenges in Maternal Mortality Data\nVery little data is available regarding maternal mortality by state, mainly due to the variation in maternal mortality committees across states. According to the CDC, “Maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs) are multidisciplinary groups that convene at the state or local level to comprehensively review deaths that occur during or within 1 year of the end of pregnancy”(n.d.) and their practices, methodology, and amount of resources vary by state. MMRCs are responsible for collecting, reviewing, and analyzing maternal mortality data and often report this data to the CDC. They also are accountable for investigating maternal deaths to determine causes and contributing factors and recommend interventions to prevent future deaths. The effectiveness of MMRCs is critical to ensuring that accurate, transparent data is accessible at the national level. This data is essential for informing public health responses, raising awareness, and improving medical practices to better address maternal mortality.\nHowever, not all states prioritize their MMRCs equally, which leads to inconsistent and, in some cases, under-representative reporting of maternal deaths and complications. This issue became especially clear in November 2024, when Georgia disbanded its MMRC entirely, dismissing all members after “confidential information” was “inappropriately leaked to the public.”(Yurkanin 2024) The information in question revealed details of two preventable maternal deaths where doctors hesitated to provide life-saving care due to Georgia’s restrictive abortion laws.\nThe disbanding of Georgia’s MMRC highlights the fragility of maternal mortality data and the outsized control states have over both women’s access to abortion and efforts to preserve maternal health. In the current polarized landscape of abortion policy, this raises serious concerns about the integrity and accessibility of maternal mortality data moving forward. Without reliable data and robust investigative processes, public health efforts to address maternal mortality and disparities will suffer, leaving critical gaps in understanding and action at a time when they are most needed.\n\n\nTime Frame\nWhen this project began, it had been just over two years since the Dobbs decision. It would have been insightful to look at the effect of Dobbs on our variables (maternal, infant, and overall health and maternal wellness). Still, too little time has passed for us to be able to gather data on the impact of state-level abortion policies on these conditions. Though this will be valuable insight, it is inherently limited by the fact that a substantial amount of time will have to have passed for a true effect to settle in.\nAdditionally, for feasibility purposes, the majority of numerical data on our variables of interest were taken from the year 2022 or the most recent year since. That being said, the association of abortion policy levels with maternal, infant, and overall health and maternal wellness conditions were only compared to the state values from one year. There always exists the possibility of random variation or anomalies in different years. Thus, we cannot be sure that the data from the most recent year before the Dobbs decision is holistically representative of the true conditions in each state. We must recognize that a state’s point values in one year are not the true population representation of its outcomes. Future research should look into quantifying representative metrics of the overall conditions in each state for a more well-rounded and reliable comparison to abortion policy level.\n\n\nMissing Datasets\nThere is a substantial amount of missing data in the realm of maternal health and abortions, which limits our ability to paint a holistic and meaningful story of the true consequences related to varying and restrictive abortion policies. We were unable to gather data regarding miscarriages, pregnancy complications, and unsafe abortions as a result of or linked to the inability to obtain an abortion. All of these variables provide valuable and critical insight into the true conditions regarding the link between reproductive rights and women’s health. Initially, we sought to explore whether miscarriage rates varied by state, how unsafe abortion rates evolved over time, illegal abortion rates, and data on women whose lives were endangered by the inability to access safe abortion services. However, these datasets either do not exist or are difficult to locate, as we encountered significant challenges in finding trustworthy sources.\nAn analysis of these conditions could have significantly bolstered this project’s impact, but many elements might be responsible for this absence of information. These types of conditions are very complex to track– for example, miscarriages and illegal abortions often go unreported because they can happen in private without doctor interaction. Furthermore, stringent regulations surround all research done on pregnant women. However, the absence of these data sets is telling in and of itself and is an issue for women’s health and public health on the whole regardless of political perspective or affiliation."

    "section": "Future research",
    "text": "Future research\nThis project provides an important foundation for understanding the relationship between abortion policies implemented after the Dobbs decision and the baseline conditions in states before the Supreme Court ruling. However, it also raises important questions and invites further exploration to deepen and expand upon the insights drawn from this initial work.\nFirst, the methods employed in this project should be enhanced to yield more nuanced and impactful findings. Incorporating additional statistical techniques, exploring advanced methodologies, and integrating machine learning models could enable comprehensive predictive analyses and offer stronger validation of observed disparities across states. Moreover, as previously discussed, including more longitudinal data would allow future research to better capture trends over time, offering a clearer understanding of how evolving state conditions align with changes in abortion policy. Continued research should aim to include a broader range of conditions and indicators with indirect links to the effects of abortion policy, enhancing the depth and comprehensiveness of this project’s insights. A particularly imperative angle that deserves more attention is further research on the racial and ethnic disparities of maternal health and wellness, and how gaps will continue to widen as a result of varying abortion policies. We performed preliminary analysis on infant and maternal mortality among white and Black women across all states in the U.S., and the results of the t-test provided statistically significant evidence to suggest that there is a difference in deaths between the races for both indicators. The accompanying visualization verifies that both infant mortality and maternal mortality are greater among Black women than white.\n \nSocioeconomic status is another characteristic that may cause disparities in the effects of abortion policy, and warrants further investigation. Understanding these disproportionate effects is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and support to the most vulnerable groups.\nA critical next step is the development of a centralized, comprehensive database containing data on a wide range of factors related to abortion and maternity. Data availability and inconsistency were significant limitations of this project, and the creation of a unified and accessible resource would not only address these challenges but also promote broader research efforts. Such a database would improve data usability and transparency, fostering better surveillance and deeper insights into maternal health trends.\nFinally, in the years ahead, research should assess the long-term effects of post-Dobbs abortion policies on maternal and societal conditions. This work will require time to allow for meaningful changes to emerge and be measured, but it is vital for assessing the full impact of these policies and shaping informed responses in the future."

    "text": "Statistical methods & models\nTo analyze the association between various health and wellness conditions in each state in 2022 or earlier and the eventual implemented level of abortion policy post Dobbs decision, we used four hypothesis testing methods. Our variable of interest (the abortion policy level) is a multinomial categorical variable, but it has many limiting characteristics that violate assumptions for many common baseline methods, such as ANOVA and Chi-square. The sample sizes (the count of observations in each level of abortion policy) were very uneven, and some sample sizes were extremely small (with a total count of 2), which violates the assumptions of some methods. In particular, this violates Chi-square’s assumption that the expected count frequency for each variable combination is at least 5. This also violates ANOVA’s assumptions of homoscedasticity and the normality of residuals, because one abortion policy level was composed of two states, while there were sixteen states with very restrictive abortion policies. Therefore, we made sure to deploy statistical tests that were appropriate for our small and uneven data. These tests and their use cases are described below.\nFor assessing the association between numerical variables and abortion policy level:\n\nPermutation-based ANOVA test\n\nThis is a non-parametric, robust alternative to traditional ANOVA that evaluates differences in means between levels of a categorical variable without requiring the assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances.\nNull hypothesis → the means across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group mean is significantly different from the rest.\n\nKruskal-Wallis\n\nThis is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between the medians of two or more independent groups by comparing the ranks of data across groups to test for differences rather than relying on raw data values. This test also permits data that does not meet the assumptions for ANOVA.\nNull hypothesis → The medians across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group median is significantly different from the rest.\n\n\nFor assessing the association between binary variables and abortion policy level:\n\nFisher’s Exact Test\n\nThis is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a contingency table. It is an appropriate alternative to the Chi-square test when sample size assumption, which states that the expected frequencies in all contingency table cells must be greater than 5, is violated. Our data naturally violates this assumption, making Fisher’s Exact Test a suitable method for assessing differences among our small abortion policy levels.\nNull hypothesis → There is no association between the binary variable and the abortion policy.\nAlternative hypothesis → There is an association between the binary variable and the abortion policy\n\nExact Logistic Regression\n\nThis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary outcome (dependent variable) and an independent variable, particularly when traditional logistic regression assumptions are violated. When sample sizes are very small, traditional logistic regression may produce unreliable results due to large standard errors. This test calculates exact p-values for parameter estimates rather than relying on asymptotic approximations.\nNull hypothesis → The abortion policy has no effect on the probability of the binary outcome\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one level of abortion policy significantly affects the probability of the binary outcome\n\n\nRelevant and insightful data visualizations were also provided alongside these tests to illuminate the characteristics of the data and provide additional information on the differences among abortion policy levels. Please see the Results section for our statistical testing outcomes."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThough neither the foster care rates per capita nor the school rankings showed statistically significant differences across abortion policy categories in the Kruskal-Wallis tests, the observed boxplot patterns do warrant further investigation. Future studies could use outcomes such as access to pediatric healthcare, child-focused social services, and education funding as key variables to better understand how state-level policies influence child wellness and to provide a more comprehensive view of systemic disparities."

    "text": "Abortion is one of the most divisive and consequential political issues in the United States. In 1973, the landmark Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to abortion nationwide. However, in 2022, the Court overturned this precedent in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which shifted the power to regulate abortion to individual state governments. This ruling has led to a patchwork of abortion laws, with restrictions and protections varying dramatically across the country. As a result, abortion has emerged as a pivotal and polarizing voting issue. A KFF study found it to be the top concern for women under 30 heading into the 2024 presidential election(Oct 11 2024). Public opinion surveys, including a 2022 Pew Research study, reveal that a majority of Americans continue to support the right to abortion, even across diverse demographics (Adkins et al. 2024).\nThe United States faces a critical lack of data transparency surrounding abortion and maternal health—a challenge that has become even more urgent in the fragmented post-Dobbs landscape. While ethical debates often dominate discussions about abortion, they frequently overshadow critical empirical evidence. The absence of comprehensive, standardized data leaves policymakers and advocates without the tools necessary to address the disproportionate burden placed on marginalized communities. Furthermore, the inconsistency of resources across state regulations not only perpetuates disparities in maternal health outcomes but also obstructs meaningful, data-driven policymaking. Without immediate efforts to close this data gap, the inequities in healthcare access and maternal wellness will deepen, with devastating consequences for the nation’s more vulnerable populations. \nThe bar char and map below visualize the distribution of the level of protectiveness or restrictiveness in state-level abortion policies across the country.  \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(usmap)\nlibrary(sf)\n\npolicy_travel &lt;- read.csv(\"data/clean_data/policy_travel_jlin.csv\")\npolicy_travel$X &lt;- NULL\n\n# Create policy_distribution by grouping and counting states by abortion_policies\npolicy_distribution &lt;- policy_travel %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  summarise(State_Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(abortion_policies = factor(abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\")))\n\n# Plot abortion policies across US states\nggplot(policy_distribution, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = State_Count, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", width = 0.7) +\n    geom_text(\n        aes(label = State_Count),\n        hjust = 1.1,\n        size = 6,\n        color = \"black\"\n    ) +\n    scale_fill_manual(\n        values = c(\n            \"most restrictive\" = \"#c61a09\",\n            \"very restrictive\" = \"#ff0000\",\n            \"restrictive\" = \"#ff6242\",\n            \"some restrictions/protections\" = \"#fab733\",\n            \"protective\" = \"#acdf87\",\n            \"very protective\" = \"#68bb59\",\n            \"most protective\" = \"#1c7416\"\n        )\n    ) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Abortion Policies Across U.S. States (2023)\",\n        subtitle = \"States categorized by level of policy restrictiveness\",\n        x = NULL, \n        y = NULL, \n        fill = \"Policy Level\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\n    ) +\n    coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot indicates that there are many more restrictive states than protective states, with a total of 27 states having restrictive policies compared to 18 states with protective policies.

    "text": "Motivation & Case Studies\nSince the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, numerous stories have emerged illustrating the devastating impact of abortion bans on women’s and children’s health. In 2023, 18-year-old Nevaeh Crain, six months pregnant, experienced a miscarriage that ultimately claimed her life due to delays in medical care caused by Texas’s restrictive abortion laws (Etienne 2024). Despite visiting three emergency rooms with severe symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and heavy bleeding, Crain was repeatedly sent home because her baby’s heartbeat was still detectable. Under Texas law, doctors were unable to intervene until fetal demise could be definitively confirmed, even as her condition rapidly worsened. Crain developed sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection, and her condition progressed to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing internal bleeding. By the time medical staff confirmed the fetus was no longer viable, it was too late. Crain died in the intensive care unit, hours after black blood poured from her mouth and nose—a devastating outcome medical experts later said could have been prevented with timely intervention(Etienne 2024).  Similarly, in Georgia, Amber Thurman died after complications from a legal medication abortion were left untreated due to the state’s restrictive abortion laws (Surana 2024). She needed a routine dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove retained fetal tissue, but doctors delayed the procedure for over 20 hours, fearing prosecution under the 2022 abortion ban. Like Crain, Thurman’s condition rapidly worsened as she developed sepsis, and despite clear signs she was dying–including low blood pressure, organ failure, and infection–doctors hesitated to act. By the time they operated, it was too late, and Thurman died during surgery, leaving behind her 6-year-old son  (Surana 2024). A review committee later deemed her death “preventable,” citing the delay in care as a critical factor. \nThese broader trends are tragically reflected in the individual stories of Naveah Crain and Amber Thurman, whose preventable deaths exemplify the real-world consequences of restrictive reproductive laws. A study by Stevenson (2021) projected a 7% increase in maternal mortality in the first year following widespread abortion bans, with the rate rising to 23% in the subsequent year, highlighting the immediate and severe health risks associated with restrictive abortion policies (Stevenson 2021). Notably, vulnerable populations, including racial minorities and those with low socioeconomic status, are disproportionately affected. Moreover, the repercussions of restrictive abortion laws extend far beyond direct maternal health outcomes. Adkins et al. found that states that implemented TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws–which impose specific regulatory requirements on abortion providers that are stricter than those for other medical procedures of a similar nature–saw an 11% increase in children placed in the foster care system (Adkins et al. 2024). In tandem, Wallace et al. found that each additional TRAP law corresponded to a 3.4% increase in the likelihood that women fall victim to domestic partner violence (Wallace et al. 2024). These findings demonstrate the far-reaching consequences of abortion policies, which exacerbate vulnerabilities for children, women, and their families well beyond the immediate health impacts."

    "text": "Research Questions\nThis research project takes a data-driven approach to provide objective insight into the underlying conditions associated with abortion and reproductive rights before the Dobbs decision. By examining these relationships, we aim to better understand the factors that may have informed varying levels of abortion policy strictness. To achieve this, we gathered comprehensive data on maternal, child, and overall health outcomes, along with maternal wellness indicators, across states in the most recent year prior to the Dobbs decision with available data. Additionally, we distinguished states based on their level of abortion policy strictness in 2023, using a classification scheme with seven levels created by KFF. Using R Studio, we employed data visualization and statistical testing to address our central research question: What is the association between health and wellness conditions in a state prior to the Dobbs decision, and their abortion policy implemented after the ruling?\nThis project aspires to provide a concrete, evidence-based understanding of the relationship between maternal health and abortion policy. By grounding the policy discourse in women’s lived experiences and measurable health outcomes, this research advocates for greater accountability and oversight in the development of abortion policies. It underscores the need for evidence-based decision-making that transcends political and personal ideologies on a subject so deeply impactful to women’s health and rights.\n\nData science question: What is the association between health and wellness conditions in a state prior to the Dobbs decision and their abortion policy implemented after the ruling?\nSubquestions:\n\nWhat is the association between prior maternal health outcomes and abortion policy? \nWhat is the association between prior infant health outcomes and abortion policy?\nWhat is the association between prior overall health outcomes and abortion policy?\nWhat is the association between prior maternal wellness conditions and abortion policy?\n\nThe diagram below provides an overview of the structure underlying each of these subquestions and the variables investigated.

Conversely, as abortion policies become more restrictive, maternal mortality rates show a stark increase, with the “most restrictive” states exhibiting the highest medians and the greatest variability.\nTo evaluate if this observed trend is statistically significant, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 15.751, df = 6, p-value = 0.01516\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a p-value of 0.009736, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that maternal mortality rates significantly differ across at least one abortion policy group. This statistical result aligns with the trends observed in the box plot: maternal mortality rates are highest and most variable in states with the “most restrictive” abortion policies and vice versa. These findings underscore the disparity in maternal health conditions observed in states with restrictive abortion policies, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in these environments with limited reproductive rights.\nTo further confirm these findings, we will perform a permutation test on the ANOVA mean differences:\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean maternal mortality rates are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level has a significantly different mean maternal mortality rate compared to the others.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = `maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Maternal Mortality Rate per 100,000\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Maternal Mortality Rate 2020-2022 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart demonstrates that states with the most protective abortion policies exhibit the lowest mean maternal mortality rates per 100,000 live births, while states with the most restrictive policies have the highest mean rates, further highlighting a potential relationship between the level of abortion policy restrictiveness and maternal health outcomes.\nTo further complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and explore whether these observed differences in means were statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was conducted to provide additional insight into the statistical reliability of these findings.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` &lt;- sample(permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 3.595385 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0067 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a statistically significant p-value of 0.0067, confirming that the observed F-statistic of 3.595385 lies well beyond the bulk of the null distribution, providing strong evidence to support the conclusion that there is a true mean difference in maternal mortality rates across the abortion policy groups. The observed value’s position far to the right of the null distribution reinforces the conclusion that these differences are not due to random chance, highlighting a meaningful relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and maternal mortality rates.\n\n\n\nAbortions play a critical role in maternal health and preventing mortality in situations where they are medically necessary to save the mother’s life. Restricting or banning abortions increases the risk of maternal mortality, as women may be denied access to life-saving interventions in cases of complicated or life-threatening pregnancies. It is reasonable to anticipate that maternal mortality rates will climb further post-Dobbs, as states with restrictive abortion policies were already associated with higher maternal mortality rates (data is from 2020-2022). These states have historically demonstrated limited access to necessary reproductive healthcare, and further restrictions will likely exacerbate the systemic challenges that contribute to preventable maternal deaths.\nAdditionally, such restrictions force women, including those who are too young, facing serious health risks, or lacking financial resources or adequate health insurance, to carry pregnancies to term. These factors, which are all associated with higher maternal mortality risks, create compounded challenges for women forced into unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. By implementing restrictive abortion policies, despite data showing higher maternal mortality rates, states are effectively creating conditions that increase preventable deaths among women. This raises significant ethical and public health concerns about the systemic disregard for maternal well-being in these policy decisions."

Conversely, as abortion policies become more restrictive, maternal mortality rates show a stark increase, with the “most restrictive” states exhibiting the highest medians and the greatest variability.\nTo evaluate if this observed trend is statistically significant, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 15.751, df = 6, p-value = 0.01516\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a p-value of 0.009736, indicating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that maternal mortality rates significantly differ across at least one abortion policy group. This statistical result aligns with the trends observed in the box plot: maternal mortality rates are highest and most variable in states with the “most restrictive” abortion policies and vice versa. These findings underscore the disparity in maternal health conditions observed in states with restrictive abortion policies, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in these environments with limited reproductive rights.\nTo further confirm these findings, we will perform a permutation test on the ANOVA mean differences:\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean maternal mortality rates are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level has a significantly different mean maternal mortality rate compared to the others.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = `maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Maternal Mortality Rate per 100,000\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Maternal Mortality Rate 2020-2022 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart demonstrates that states with the most protective abortion policies exhibit the lowest mean maternal mortality rates per 100,000 live births, while states with the most restrictive policies have the highest mean rates, further highlighting a potential relationship between the level of abortion policy restrictiveness and maternal health outcomes.\nTo further complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and explore whether these observed differences in means were statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was conducted to provide additional insight into the statistical reliability of these findings.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` &lt;- sample(permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 3.595385 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0067 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a statistically significant p-value of 0.0067, confirming that the observed F-statistic of 3.595385 lies well beyond the bulk of the null distribution, providing strong evidence to support the conclusion that there is a true mean difference in maternal mortality rates across the abortion policy groups. The observed value’s position far to the right of the null distribution reinforces the conclusion that these differences are not due to random chance, highlighting a meaningful relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and maternal mortality rates.\n\n\n\nAbortions play a critical role in maternal health and preventing mortality in situations where they are medically necessary to save the mother’s life. Restricting or banning abortions increases the risk of maternal mortality, as women may be denied access to life-saving interventions in cases of complicated or life-threatening pregnancies. It is reasonable to anticipate that maternal mortality rates will climb further post-Dobbs, as states with restrictive abortion policies were already associated with higher maternal mortality rates (data is from 2020-2022). These states have historically demonstrated limited access to necessary reproductive healthcare, and further restrictions will likely exacerbate the systemic challenges that contribute to preventable maternal deaths.\nAdditionally, such restrictions force women, including those who are too young, facing serious health risks, or lacking financial resources or adequate health insurance, to carry pregnancies to term. These factors, which are all associated with higher maternal mortality risks, create compounded challenges for women forced into unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. By implementing restrictive abortion policies, despite data showing higher maternal mortality rates, states are effectively creating conditions that increase preventable deaths among women. This raises significant ethical and public health concerns about the systemic disregard for maternal well-being in these policy decisions."

This includes increased pressure on already strained healthcare systems, reduced funding for maternal health programs, and a potential deterrent effect on providers offering comprehensive reproductive care. Together, these factors could worsen disparities, leaving more women unable to access the care they need during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, particularly in underserved communities which reinforces the interconnectedness of abortion policy, maternal health, and systemic inequities in healthcare access."

As abortion policies become more restrictive, the median percentage of uninsured women increases, with “very restrictive” and “most restrictive” states showing significantly higher medians and greater variability. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with a lack of access to insurance coverage during pregnancy, potentially exacerbating barriers to prenatal care.\nTo explore this observed association further, a Kruskal-Wallis test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.576, df = 6, p-value = 0.03475\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a p-value of 0.03475, providing significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

This deviation could reflect unique policy or demographic factors in those states. However, the broader trend suggests that more restrictive abortion policies may align with higher uninsured rates during pregnancy.\nTo further validate the significance of these findings, we will now perform an ANOVA permutation test.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is the same across all abortion policy groups.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is different in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.4)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows that states with more protective abortion policies have the lowest mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy, as abortion policies become more restrictive, the mean percentage of uninsured women generally increases, peaking at the “very restrictive” level before dropping at the “most restrictive” level.\nTo strengthen the evidence for statistical significance,an ANOVA Permutation Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 4.561629 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0252 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a p-value of 0.0252, providing statistically significant evidence to support differences in the percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy across at least one abortion policy level.

THis ultimately suggests that further tightening will worsen gaps in coverage and maternal health outcomes, especially in states with limited resources. Increasingly restrictive policies may contribute to increased maternal mortality and morbidity by limiting access to affordable prenatal care, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment. Additionally, healthcare providers may be less inclined to practice in these states, further reducing access to quality care. Over time, these conditions could place growing financial strain on households and healthcare systems, deepening existing inequities."

Additionally, as policies become more restrictive, the spread and variability of teen birth rates increase, particularly in the most restrictive category. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies may be indicative of broader socio-economic and health disparities contributing to higher teen birth rates.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 25.544, df = 6, p-value = 0.0002706\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a statistically significant p-value of 0.0002706, providing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This suggests that the median teen birth rate significantly differs across at least one of the abortion policy categories with the variability observed in the box plot aligns with this finding, indicating that states with more restrictive abortion policies tend to have higher median teen birth rates compared to states with more protective policies.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis test and further evaluate the significance of these differences, an ANOVA permutation test was performed.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean teen birth rate (per 1,000 population, ages 15–19) is the same across all abortion policy groups.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): The mean teen birth rate (per 1,000 population, ages 15–19) differs in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y =`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022`, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 0.4)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Teen Birth Rate per 100,000\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Teen Birth Rate by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates that states with more protective abortion policies tend to have the lowest mean teen birth rates, while states with more restrictive abortion policies exhibit progressively higher mean teen birth rates with the highest birth rate observed in states with the “most restrictive” policies. This suggests an association between more restrictive abortion policies and higher teen birth rates.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 100000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022` &lt;- sample(permuted_data$`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022`)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(`teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022` ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 7.771021 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 1e-05 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test’s extremely small p-value, 1e-05, provides compelling statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the mean teen birth rate differs significantly across the different levels of state abortion policies. The observed F-statistic lies far in the tail of the permutation distribution, reinforcing the conclusion that the observed differences in mean teen birth rates among the policy groups are unlikely to have occurred by chance. This supports the notion of a strong association between state abortion policy levels and variations in teen birth rates.\n\n\nImplications\nThese findings highlight that more restrictive abortion policies correlate with higher teen birth rates, potentially forcing adolescents into parenthood without adequate support, imposing long-term financial and emotional burdens on young families, as well as strain on healthcare and social services. While we have not examined related factors like comprehensive sex education, these results raise questions about whether states with more restrictive abortion policies also fail to invest enough in preventive measures and support systems, prompting a need for more research and evidence-based policy interventions."

The more protective categories have relatively stable, modest increases, while the most restrictive categories show lower median increases after a point, possibly indicating fewer opportunities for clinician-provided services. This pattern suggests that the relationship between abortion policy strictness and changes in clinician-provided abortion services is not linear, with mid-level restrictive states experiencing the greatest relative growth.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(`percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 6.8766, df = 6, p-value = 0.3324\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test produces a p-value of 0.3324, which is not statistically significant, therefore failing to reject the null hypothesis that the median percent increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020 is the same across all abortion policy groups. In other words, these data do not provide evidence that differences in policy strictness are associated with meaningful differences in clinician-provided abortion rate increases.\n\n\nImplications\nThese results, or lack thereof, demonstrate that whatever policy distinctions exist did not translate into measurable changes in the metric we tested. It may suggest that this variable isn’t sensitive to policy variations, other factors overshadow policy influence, or it was included without a clear rationale. Without evidence of a meaningful relationship, focusing research efforts elsewhere might be more productive."

    "text": "Conclusion\nEvidently, maternal health outcomes differ by abortion policy level, where protective policies often align with lower maternal mortality rates, fewer uninsured pregnant women, and lower teen birth rates. This suggests that states with supportive abortion policies coincide with better access to essential healthcare services and resources for women. By contrast, restrictive policies correlate with higher maternal mortality and teen birth rates, plus more uninsured pregnant women. This association implies that states limiting abortion access may also limit other forms of care, leaving women without adequate prenatal and postnatal support. In practice, this can force both adolescents and adults into parenthood under challenging conditions, with potential long-term social and economic consequences."

The slope coefficients and corresponding visualization indicate that the likelihood of having a mandatory parental leave policy (y=1) increases as abortion policies become more protective. This means that states with abortion policies that are more protective of reproductive rights are significantly more likely to mandate parental leave compared to states with restrictive abortion policies. These findings are significant as they underscore a critical contradiction: states that impose restrictive abortion policies, effectively limiting access to abortion and forcing women to carry pregnancies to term, are often the same states that fail to provide supportive measures, such as mandatory parental leave. This creates an environment that not only restricts reproductive autonomy but also neglects the financial stability and overall well-being of mothers, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in states with restrictive abortion rights, emphasizing the disparity in care and support provided to mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): There is no association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\n\n\nCode\n# Reorder the levels of abortion policies\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(parental_leave_job_protection), fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parental Leave Job Protection Policy\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Job Protection Requirements by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"No Job Protection\", \"1\" = \"Job Protection\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot suggests that states that provide job protection for parental leave are predominantly associated with protective abortion policies, while states without job protection are more likely to have restrictive abortion policies. This visualization accentuates a potential correlation, suggesting that states fostering better protections for parental leave are also those that support more protective abortion policies.\nTo explore this relationship further, Fisher’s Exact Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's exact test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.006869\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nFisher’s Exact Test yields a p-value of 0.006869, providing sufficient evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between state abortion policy levels and the presence of job protection for parental leave. This result indicates that abortion policy restrictiveness or protectiveness is strongly related to whether states have policies safeguarding job security for individuals taking parental leave.\nBefore performing logistic regression, it is necessary to confirm that the data meets the required assumptions:\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): Abortion policy levels have no effect on the probability of job protection for parental leave.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level significantly affects the probability of job protection for parental leave.\n\n\nCode\n# Tabulate categories to see if sample sizes are sufficient\ntable(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               1               4          6                             3\n  1               1               3          4                             2\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           7                4               16\n  1           0                0                0\n\n\nThe sample sizes are too small for standard logistic regression, particularly for categories like “restrictive”, very restrictive”, and “most restrictive,” which lack representation in one of the outcome groups.

These findings suggests that states with more protective abortion policies are more likely to have legislation guaranteeing job protection for parents taking parental leave to care for their children.\nCoefficients and visualization support this finding, showing a positive association between protective abortion policies and the likelihood of job protection policies. Alternatively, states with restrictive abortion policies often lack similar protections. These results emphasize another systemic contradiction: states that limit abortion access and force women to carry pregnancies to term often fail to establish policies that support parents, such as guaranteeing job protection during parental leave. This lack of support exacerbates the financial and social challenges for parents, notably women, creating an environment where having children is marked by financial insecurity and career uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The medians of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level is associated with a significantly different median percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Employed\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Employed by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plots illustrates that states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have a higher median percentage of women employed compared to states with more restrictive policies. Further, there is greater variability in the employment percentages in states with restrictive policies, and notable outliers are present in several categories.\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_working by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.889, df = 6, p-value = 0.0309\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant p-value of 0.0309, allowing us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the median percentage of women employed across at least one level of abortion policy. However, examining the above box plot visualization, it is evident that the relationship is not straightforward. For example, states with “very protective” abortion policies exhibit a surprisingly low median employment percentage—the second lowest across all groups, after states with the most restrictive policies. This deviation highlights an outlier among the protective policy groups and suggests that other factors beyond abortion policy restrictiveness may be influencing female employment rates in these states. This observation warrants further investigation into state-specific socioeconomic conditions or other contextual variables that could explain these discrepancies.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy categories.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy category is associated with a significantly different mean percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean % Women Working\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Working by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plots suggests a modest pattern: states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have somewhat higher mean percentages of working women, while those with increasingly restrictive policies show slightly lower averages. However, these differences appear small, indicating that if there is a trend, it may not be pronounced or other factors could be influencing women’s employment levels.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation test\nn_perm &lt;- 10000 \n\n# observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\nset.seed(6547) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(n_perm)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_perm) {\n  # permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_women_working &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_women_working)\n  \n  # ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.588987 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0296 \n\n\nCode\n# visualization\nhist(perm_F, breaks = 30, main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", xlab = \"F-statistic\", col = \"#acdf87\")\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the ANOVA further confirms a significant p-value (p = 0.0296), providing evidence that the mean percentage of employed women in at least one abortion policy category differs from the others. However, as observed in the visualizations, this does not necessarily indicate a straightforward or “linear” relationship between more protective abortion policies and higher female employment rates.\n\n\n\nThe results from the Economic Wellness hypothesis testing indicate that abortion policies often reflect broader policy environments influencing women’s economic stability. States with restrictive abortion policies not only limit reproductive autonomy but have also failed to foster preexisting conditions that support women’s workforce participation and financial independence, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable women. Therefore, it’s essential for policymakers to address these intersecting challenges by advocating for comprehensive workplace protections, such as mandatory parental leave, job security policies, equitable access to affordable childcare, and other measures that enable women to achieve economic independence, regardless of their reproductive choices."

The slope coefficients and corresponding visualization indicate that the likelihood of having a mandatory parental leave policy (y=1) increases as abortion policies become more protective. This means that states with abortion policies that are more protective of reproductive rights are significantly more likely to mandate parental leave compared to states with restrictive abortion policies. These findings are significant as they underscore a critical contradiction: states that impose restrictive abortion policies, effectively limiting access to abortion and forcing women to carry pregnancies to term, are often the same states that fail to provide supportive measures, such as mandatory parental leave. This creates an environment that not only restricts reproductive autonomy but also neglects the financial stability and overall well-being of mothers, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in states with restrictive abortion rights, emphasizing the disparity in care and support provided to mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): There is no association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\n\n\nCode\n# Reorder the levels of abortion policies\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(parental_leave_job_protection), fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parental Leave Job Protection Policy\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Job Protection Requirements by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"No Job Protection\", \"1\" = \"Job Protection\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot suggests that states that provide job protection for parental leave are predominantly associated with protective abortion policies, while states without job protection are more likely to have restrictive abortion policies. This visualization accentuates a potential correlation, suggesting that states fostering better protections for parental leave are also those that support more protective abortion policies.\nTo explore this relationship further, Fisher’s Exact Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's exact test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.006869\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nFisher’s Exact Test yields a p-value of 0.006869, providing sufficient evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between state abortion policy levels and the presence of job protection for parental leave.

These findings suggests that states with more protective abortion policies are more likely to have legislation guaranteeing job protection for parents taking parental leave to care for their children.\nCoefficients and visualization support this finding, showing a positive association between protective abortion policies and the likelihood of job protection policies. Alternatively, states with restrictive abortion policies often lack similar protections. These results emphasize another systemic contradiction: states that limit abortion access and force women to carry pregnancies to term often fail to establish policies that support parents, such as guaranteeing job protection during parental leave. This lack of support exacerbates the financial and social challenges for parents, notably women, creating an environment where having children is marked by financial insecurity and career uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The medians of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level is associated with a significantly different median percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Employed\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Employed by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plots illustrates that states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have a higher median percentage of women employed compared to states with more restrictive policies. Further, there is greater variability in the employment percentages in states with restrictive policies, and notable outliers are present in several categories.\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_working by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.889, df = 6, p-value = 0.0309\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant p-value of 0.0309, allowing us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the median percentage of women employed across at least one level of abortion policy. However, examining the above box plot visualization, it is evident that the relationship is not straightforward. For example, states with “very protective” abortion policies exhibit a surprisingly low median employment percentage—the second lowest across all groups, after states with the most restrictive policies. This deviation highlights an outlier among the protective policy groups and suggests that other factors beyond abortion policy restrictiveness may be influencing female employment rates in these states. This observation warrants further investigation into state-specific socioeconomic conditions or other contextual variables that could explain these discrepancies.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy categories.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy category is associated with a significantly different mean percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean % Women Working\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Working by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plots suggests a modest pattern: states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have somewhat higher mean percentages of working women, while those with increasingly restrictive policies show slightly lower averages. However, these differences appear small, indicating that if there is a trend, it may not be pronounced or other factors could be influencing women’s employment levels.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation test\nn_perm &lt;- 10000 \n\n# observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\nset.seed(6547) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(n_perm)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_perm) {\n  # permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_women_working &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_women_working)\n  \n  # ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.588987 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0296 \n\n\nCode\n# visualization\nhist(perm_F, breaks = 30, main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", xlab = \"F-statistic\", col = \"#acdf87\")\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the ANOVA further confirms a significant p-value (p = 0.0296), providing evidence that the mean percentage of employed women in at least one abortion policy category differs from the others. However, as observed in the visualizations, this does not necessarily indicate a straightforward or “linear” relationship between more protective abortion policies and higher female employment rates.\n\n\n\nThe results from the Economic Wellness hypothesis testing indicate that abortion policies often reflect broader policy environments influencing women’s economic stability. States with restrictive abortion policies not only limit reproductive autonomy but have also failed to foster preexisting conditions that support women’s workforce participation and financial independence, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable women. Therefore, it’s essential for policymakers to address these intersecting challenges by advocating for comprehensive workplace protections, such as mandatory parental leave, job security policies, equitable access to affordable childcare, and other measures that enable women to achieve economic independence, regardless of their reproductive choices."

States with more protective abortion policies are consistently associated with higher levels of education among women, suggesting that these states may prioritize investments in policies and resources that support both reproductive autonomy and access to education. In contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies are linked to lower levels of educational attainment, potentially reflecting systemic under investment in women’s educational opportunities and broader socioeconomic support. This connection underscores the dual challenge faced by women in states with restrictive abortion policies: not only are their reproductive rights diminished, but these states also fail to create conditions that enable women to pursue and attain higher education. Such disparities highlight the need for comprehensive policy reform that addresses both reproductive rights and access to education, ensuring that women in all states, regardless of abortion policy, have equal opportunities to achieve higher educational attainment."

This suggests no statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of intimate partner violence among women and the strictness of a state’s abortion policy.\nFurther, the box plot visualization supports this finding, showing variability within and across the abortion policy levels. While the mean percentages, displayed below, indicate slightly higher rates of intimate partner violence in states with more restrictive abortion policies, this pattern is not statistically significant based on the Kruskal-Wallis test results.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"%\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nThe Mental Wellness analysis revealed that only one measure, postpartum depression screening, showed a statistically significant association with abortion policy categories. States with more protective abortion policies had higher screening rates, reflecting a broader commitment to maternal mental health care in these states. Other indicators, such as postpartum depression rates, depression before or during pregnancy, and intimate partner violence, did not show statistically significant differences across abortion policy categories. While trends in the visualizations suggest potential patterns, these outcomes highlight the influence of other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions and access to healthcare. These findings underscore the need for further research to explore the relationship between states’ abortion policy levels, maternal mental health, and systemic support."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Maternal Wellness analysis highlights how abortion policies serve as proxies for broader systemic conditions that impact women’s wellness across economic, educational, and mental health measures, emphasizing the interconnected nature of reproductive rights and systemic support for women. States with protective abortion policies are consistently associated with better outcomes—such as higher levels of educational attainment, greater economic stability through parental leave and job protection policies, and higher postpartum depression screening rates. Conversely, restrictive abortion policies are not only linked to environments that fail to support women’s autonomy, workforce participation, and access to essential health resources but also expose a key contradiction: these policies force women to carry pregnancies to term while neglecting to provide maternal wellness support, such as job protections, affordable childcare, or mental health care. This juxtaposition underscores a systemic failure to prioritize the long-term well-being of mothers and families.\nAddressing these disparities requires comprehensive policy reforms that extend beyond reproductive autonomy to include equitable access to education, employment opportunities, and mental health resources. This holistic approach is vital to improving outcomes for women, particularly in states where restrictive abortion policies coincide with limited systemic support. Following the Dobbs decision, as restrictions on abortion are likely to increase, these reforms will become even more critical to counteract the growing disparities and ensure women’s wellness is holistically supported across the United States."

The result supports the observation from the stacked bar plot: more restrictive abortion policies tend to align with poorer health outcomes, while more protective policies are associated with better health outcomes. This suggests that states with restrictive abortion policies are not only limiting access to reproductive healthcare but may also be falling behind in fostering broader public health outcomes.

In contrast, states that have expanded Medicaid show a higher proportion of protective and less restrictive abortion policies. This pattern suggests a potential relationship between policy choices around healthcare access (Medicaid expansion) and reproductive rights (abortion policies), where more progressive health policies align with broader healthcare access.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's Exact Test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.03091\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nThe Fisher’s Exact Test yielded a p-value of 0.03091, indicating a statistically significant association between Medicaid expansion status and abortion policies. This suggests that the distribution of Medicaid expansion (expanded vs. not expanded) varies significantly across different abortion policy categories. States’ decisions on Medicaid expansion may align with their stance on abortion policies.\nTo explore the direction and strength of this relationship, a logistic regression is attempted.\n\n\nExact Logistic Regression\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): Abortion policy level has no effect on the probability of Medicaid expansion.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one level of abortion policy significantly affects the probability of Medicaid expansion.\nBefore performing logistic regression, it is necessary to confirm that the data meets the required assumptions:\n\n\nCode\n# Tabulate categories to see if sample sizes are sufficient\ntable(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               0               0          0                             0\n  1               2               7         10                             5\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           3                1                7\n  1           4                3                9\n\n\nThe sample sizes are too small for standard logistic regression.

The exact logistic regression’s likelihood ratio test (p = 0.0924) suggests that the overall model is not statistically significant. However, the Wald test (p = 0.0483) and previous findings from Fisher’s Exact Test indicate that specific associations between abortion policy levels and Medicaid expansion status may be statistically significant. These differing results highlight the complexity of the relationship and suggest that while the overall model fit may not be strong, there is evidence of specific patterns worth exploring further. The trend observed in the slope coefficients indicates that states with more restrictive abortion policies tend to have lower probabilities of Medicaid expansion, whereas states with protective policies show higher probabilities of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\nImplications\nThis potential pattern may highlight a critical divide in policy decisions: states prioritizing broader reproductive rights are also more likely to expand healthcare access through Medicaid, whereas restrictive abortion policies align with reduced Medicaid expansion, which underscores the broader policy implications of prioritizing access to healthcare and reproductive rights. This alignment reflects deeper policy priorities and ideological differences between states, where those prioritizing reproductive rights often demonstrate a commitment to broader public health initiatives and social safety nets. On the other hand, states with restrictive abortion policies may deprioritize investments in Medicaid and other mechanisms that improve healthcare access for vulnerable populations, further widening disparities in healthcare equity.\nThis divide carries significant implications for health outcomes, particularly for low-income individuals and marginalized communities who depend on Medicaid for essential care. The reduced likelihood of Medicaid expansion in restrictive states may exacerbate health inequities, leading to weakened access to preventative care, maternal healthcare, and chronic disease management."

Alternatively, states with more restrictive abortion policies exhibit worse rankings, suggesting reduced coverage access and affordability. This trend may reflect that states with protective abortion policies prioritize healthcare equity and access more effectively than those with restrictive policies.\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n#Kruskal-Wallis Test\nkruskal.test(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  coverage_access_and_affordability by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 22.583, df = 6, p-value = 0.0009489\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yielded an extremely low a p-value of 0.0009489. This statistically significant result indicates that there are differences in coverage access and affordability rankings among the seven abortion policy levels. States with more restrictive abortion policies appear to have higher (worse) rankings for coverage access and affordability compared to states with more protective policies, reinforcing the association between policy restrictiveness and reduced access to affordable care.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of the coverage, access, and affordability rankings are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one group mean of the coverage, access, and affordability rankings is significantly different across abortion policy levels.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = coverage_access_and_affordability, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Coverag, Access, and Affordability\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Coverage, Access, and Affordability by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot displays that states with “most restrictive” and “very restrictive” abortion policies have the highest mean rankings, indicating poorer coverage, access, and affordability. In contrast, states with “most protective” and “very protective” abortion policies have the lowest mean rankings, reflecting better outcomes in these areas. As abortion policies become less restrictive, there is a noticeable improvement in healthcare rankings, suggesting a potential relationship between protective abortion policies and enhanced healthcare access and affordability.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test Implementation for Coverage Access and Affordability\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$coverage_access_and_affordability &lt;- sample(permuted_data$coverage_access_and_affordability)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 6.089754 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 1e-04 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yielded an extremely low p-value of 0.0001, indicating that the likelihood of observing an F-statistic as extreme as 6.089754 under the null hypothesis extremely small, providing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in the means of coverage, access, and affordability rankings across abortion policy levels, suggesting that states’ healthcare access and affordability rankings vary meaningfully based on their abortion policy classifications.\n\n\nImplications\nThe disparities in coverage, access, and affordability highlight the broader policy priorities between states with protective and restrictive abortion policies. States with protective abortion policies likely integrate reproductive healthcare into comprehensive healthcare initiatives, fostering better access and affordability. In contrast, restrictive states, which often frame their policies as being “pro-life,” may focus on generalized or inconsistent healthcare frameworks, leading to poorer outcomes. The lack of affordable and accessible healthcare in these states undermines their claims to protect life, as they fail to support the broader well-being of the populations they govern. These findings underscore both the interconnectedness between reproductive healthcare policy and overall healthcare accessibility and affordability, and the disconnect in restrictive states between policy rhetoric and actionable support for healthier communities."

To address this, we use exact logistic regression, which is suitable for small sample sizes and sparse data.\n\n\nCode\n# Logistic Regression\nlibrary(logistf)\n\n# Fit logistic regression model\nfit &lt;- logistf(state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception ~ factor(abortion_policies), data = df)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# View the results\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nlogistf(formula = state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception ~ \n    factor(abortion_policies), data = df)\n\nModel fitted by Penalized ML\nCoefficients:\n                                                             coef se(coef)\n(Intercept)                                             1.6094379 1.549193\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               -0.1431008 1.794579\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                     0.2363888 1.780990\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections -0.5108256 1.813529\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -1.8607523 1.705267\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -1.6094379 1.788854\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -2.3470369 1.633638\n                                                       lower 0.95 upper 0.95\n(Intercept)                                            -0.8993577  6.5361319\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               -5.2583237  3.1558062\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    -4.8662731  3.5104202\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections -5.6440931  2.8216151\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -6.9149344  1.0302498\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -6.7355228  1.5101927\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -7.3414344  0.3645081\n                                                             Chisq          p\n(Intercept)                                            1.455515830 0.22764495\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               0.006456591 0.93595657\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    0.017133155 0.89585942\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections 0.083322594 0.77284423\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   1.489808677 0.22224615\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              0.950172752 0.32967533\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              2.814056557 0.09344182\n                                                       method\n(Intercept)                                                 2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective                    2\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                         2\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections      2\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                        2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive                   2\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive                   2\n\nMethod: 1-Wald, 2-Profile penalized log-likelihood, 3-None\n\nLikelihood ratio test=13.07125 on 6 df, p=0.04191838, n=51\nWald test = 11.61987 on 6 df, p = 0.07100654\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate predicted probabilities\ndf$predicted_prob &lt;- predict(fit, type = \"response\")\n\n# Reorder abortion policy levels for logistic regression \ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                               levels = c(\"most restrictive\", \n                                          \"very restrictive\", \n                                          \"restrictive\", \n                                          \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                          \"protective\", \n                                          \"very protective\", \n                                          \"most protective\"))\n# Visualize predicted probabilities\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = predicted_prob)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.6) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\",\n       y = \"Predicted Probability\",\n       title = \"Predicted Probability of Prescription Contraceptive Coverage \\nby State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact logistic regression analysis provides evidence of a significant relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and the likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage, as indicated by the likelihood ratio test with a p-value of 0.0419. Among the coefficients, states classified as having “most restrictive” abortion policies show the largest negative coefficient (-2.347), indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to the reference group (“most protective”). Similarly, states with “very restrictive” policies also exhibit a negative coefficient (-1.609), further supporting this trend. In contrast, the coefficients for “protective” and “very protective” policy levels are closer to zero, reflecting smaller deviations from the reference group.\nThe predicted probabilities demonstrate a clear gradient: states with more restrictive abortion policies consistently exhibit lower probabilities of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to those with more protective policies. This pattern underscores how more restrictive policies are associated with reduced support for measures that increase contraceptive accessibility, revealing a broader policy divide between states.\n\n\nImplications\nThis pattern highlights a significant disparity in healthcare priorities between states with restrictive and protective abortion policies.By failing to require prescription coverage, particularly for contraceptives, these states not only limit access to essential tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, effectively undermining efforts to reduce the need for abortions in the first place, but also neglect the broader healthcare needs of individuals. Moreover, by not mandating prescription coverage, these states create barriers for women who rely on contraceptives for managing health conditions such as dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, or hormonal imbalances. These barriers can significantly impact quality of life for women who need access to these treatments. In contrast, states with protective abortion policies often require prescription coverage, reflecting a more comprehensive approach to healthcare that supports not only women’s reproductive autonomy but also the broader health needs of their populations."

This provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in the rankings of healthcare quality and prevention across the levels of abortion policy, suggesting that the quality of healthcare prevention services varies meaningfully depending on state abortion policy classifications.\nThis finding is further supported by the accompanying visualization, which displays the proportion of states classified as having above or below-average healthcare quality and prevention rankings across different abortion policy levels. States with more protective abortion policies are predominantly above average, while states with restrictive policies show a higher proportion of below-average rankings.

In contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies consistently rank worse, potentially indicating less emphasis on preventative care or healthcare quality. This association underscores how restrictive reproductive healthcare policies may correlate with broader systemic healthcare shortcomings, which can perpetuate or exacerbate health inequities. Furthermore, these disparities may reflect differing state priorities, where restrictive policies often coincide with under investment in public health infrastructure, potentially leading to poorer outcomes not just in reproductive health but across all facets of healthcare access and delivery. Addressing these systemic gaps may require policy reforms that align reproductive rights with a broader commitment to equitable and comprehensive healthcare."

These findings underscore the measurable impact of abortion policy restrictiveness on broader health outcomes, indicating systemic disparities in public health quality across states.\nThis finding is further supported by the accompanying visualization, which displays the proportion of states classified as having above or below-average healthcare outcome rankings across different abortion policy levels.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate the overall average\noverall_avg &lt;- mean(df$health_outcomes, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Filter and classify observations as Above or Below Average\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(abortion_policies) & !is.na(health_outcomes)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(above_or_below = if_else(health_outcomes &gt; overall_avg, \n                                  \"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"))\n\n# Group and count observations\ndf_count &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies, above_or_below) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Convert counts to percentages\ndf_count &lt;- df_count %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart\nggplot(df_count, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percentage, fill = above_or_below)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above Average\" = \"#ff0000\", \"Below Average\" = \"#1c7416\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Percentage of Observations\",\n       fill = \"Comparison to Average\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Above/Below Average Health Outcomes by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nThese trends suggest that states with more restrictive abortion policies may lack broader investments in public health infrastructure and services, contributing to poorer overall health outcomes. In contrast, states with protective abortion policies might prioritize comprehensive healthcare systems that address a wider array of health determinants. This disparity underscores the broader implications of policy decisions on public health and well-being, highlighting potential inequities in access to essential healthcare resources.States with protective policies arguably demonstrate a stronger commitment to addressing root causes of poor health through preventative care and access to essential resources, suggesting that healthcare priorities may reflect broader state-level commitments to equity and well-being."

The “protective” category displays the highest median OB-GYN ratio and the widest distribution, reflecting significant variability in access to OB-GYNs among states in this policy category. Conversely, the most restrictive policy levels are associated with lower median OB-GYN ratios, suggesting that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with reduced access to OB-GYN services. Outliers are visible in some categories, such as “very protective” and “protective,” indicating that some states deviate substantially from the typical access levels for their policy category. Overall, the plot suggests a potential relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and OB-GYN access, with more restrictive policies possibly contributing to reduced availability of reproductive healthcare providers.\nTo test for statistical significance in these observed patterns, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis Test\nkruskal.test(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  obgyn_per_100k by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 10.089, df = 6, p-value = 0.1209\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test, performed to evaluate differences in OB-GYN access across abortion policy levels, yielded a p-value of 0.1209, indicating that the observed differences in median OB-GYN ratios across the groups are not statistically significant at the commonly used 0.05 threshold.\nHowever, despite the lack of statistical significance, an ANOVA permutation test is conducted to further explore potential relationships. This is motivated by the patterns observed in the visualizations, which suggest a noticeable gradient in OB-GYN access that may merit further investigation.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of OBGYN ratios are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one group mean of OBGYN ratios is significantly different across the levels of abortion policy.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = obgyn_per_100k, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean OB-GYN Access per 100,000 Women\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean OB-GYN Access in 2023 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot displays that states with “most protective” and “very protective” abortion policies exhibit relatively high OB-GYN access, with mean values close to or above 15 OB-GYNs per 100,000 women. As abortion policies become more restrictive, a gradual decline in OB-GYN access is evident, with states categorized as “very restrictive” and “most restrictive” showing the lowest mean access levels, averaging closer to 10 or fewer OB-GYNs per 100,000 women. This gradient suggests that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with reduced access to OB-GYNs, reflecting broader healthcare limitations in these states. However, the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated no statistically significant differences, so this pattern should be interpreted cautiously and corroborated with further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# First, calculate the observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Perform permutation test\nset.seed(1234) # For reproducibility\nN &lt;- 100000 # Number of permutations\nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k &lt;- sample(permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k) # Fixed assignment\n  \n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate the p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\n# Print results\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 1.958188 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.09937 \n\n\nCode\nhist(perm_F, \n     main = \"Distribution of F-statistics under Null Hypothesis\",\n     xlab = \"F-statistic\",\n     col = \"palegreen4\", \n     breaks = 50)\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the association between OB-GYN access and abortion policy levels yielded an observed F-statistic of 1.958188 and a p-value of 0.09937 which suggests that the differences observed in the mean OB-GYN access across abortion policy levels are not statistically significant at a conventional threshold (e.g., 0.05). Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the variation in OB-GYN access across these policy levels may be due to random chance.\nDespite the lack of statistical significance, the visualization below provides valuable insight into the distribution of OB-GYN access by abortion policy levels. It shows that states with more protective abortion policies generally have a higher proportion of observations with above-average OB-GYN access, whereas more restrictive states are more likely to fall below average. While these patterns are not confirmed by the statistical test, they may still point to meaningful differences in healthcare infrastructure that merit further investigation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate the overall average\noverall_avg &lt;- mean(df$obgyn_per_100k, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Filter and classify observations as Above or Below Average\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(abortion_policies) & !is.na(obgyn_per_100k)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(above_or_below = if_else(obgyn_per_100k &gt; overall_avg, \n                                  \"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"))\n\n# Group and count observations\ndf_count &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies, above_or_below) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Convert counts to percentages\ndf_count &lt;- df_count %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart\nggplot(df_count, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percentage, fill = above_or_below)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above Average\" = \"#1c7416\", \"Below Average\" = \"#ff0000\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Percentage of Observations\",\n       fill = \"Comparison to Average\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Above/Below Average OBGYN Ratio by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nDespite the lack of statistical significance in the association between OB-GYN access and abortion policy levels, this analysis was worth exploring due to the visible patterns in the data.These patterns raise important questions about the alignment of restrictive abortion policies with broader commitments to women’s healthcare access.Further research could help explore and clarify this relationship, potentially identifying ways to address healthcare gaps and improve outcomes for underserved and vulnerable populations."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe overall health analysis demonstrates that abortion policy levels are strongly associated with broader public health indicators, including overall health rankings, healthcare quality, access, and affordability. States with protective abortion policies consistently perform better across these measures, suggesting a commitment to fostering equitable healthcare systems that prioritize both reproductive rights and general healthcare access. These states likely integrate reproductive healthcare into broader public health initiatives, addressing root causes of poor health and promoting preventative care.In contrast, restrictive abortion policies are frequently associated with poorer health outcomes, lower healthcare quality, and reduced access to essential services. These patterns suggest that states with restrictive polcies may not only limit reproductive autonomy but also systemically under investm in public health infrastructure which can exacerbate existing inequities, leaving vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, without adequate healthcare resources.\nAlthough some relationships, such as OB-GYN access by abortion policy, did not achieve statistical significance, visible trends warrant further investigation. Future research could explore these patterns with more granular data or alternative methodologies to better understand the systemic implications of abortion policy restrictiveness on healthcare equity."
