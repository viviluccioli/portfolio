Furthermore, I’m fluent in Italian and Spanish, and I love meeting people with different backgrounds than mine (whether that be culturally or academically). I’m passionate about harnessing my unique perspective and analytical skills to catalyze data-driven solutions that create meaningful social impact.\nIf you have any questions or even just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at vcl16@georgetown.edu – I’m always happy to make a new connection. :)\nLinkedin | GitHub"
